In the era of ubiquitous digital technology, robust user authentication is paramount. While traditional methods like passwords have served us, they falter in todayâ€™s complex landscape. Multi factor authentication (MFA) using machine learning (ML) offers a potent solution. By harnessing bio metrics, behavior patterns, and facial recognition, MFA creates a resilient and adaptable authentication process. This sophisticated approach bolsters security while ensuring a seamless user experience, making it the vanguard of user-centeric authentication in the digital age.
